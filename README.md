A school project calculator capable of evaluating quite complex math expressions.

It's a relatively well written and quite an advanced calculater with a few downsides: 

1) The controller (basically main) class has never been refactored and looks like that (didn't have time). 

2) The generics are a bit overused and don't always make sense (I kinda didn't understand them properly at that time).

3) I never got to fully implement Exceptions so the calculator will sorta work even with invalid input.

Features:

Binary operators (+, -, *, ...), C# double type precision, custom variables, gonimetric funcitons (sin, cos, tan), compare operators (true => 1, false => 0), if function (if(condition; result if true; result if false)), nested function, brackets support, quite a nice modular design, ...
